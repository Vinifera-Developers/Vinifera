// Description:
//
//   Imagine ("Image Engine") is a 256 bit image processing library that provides

//   contains an early reference version of the resampling routines from the library.
//
//   This source code is provided for educational purposes and lacks significant 
//   optimizations that are available in the full version of Imagine. To download
