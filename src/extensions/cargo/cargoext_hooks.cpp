/**
 *  #issue-1093
 *
 *  CargoClass::Attach can attach multiple objects to the
 *  cargo depending on the linked list of units (ObjectClass.Next).
 *  The function is "dual-use" and used for both linking reinforcement
 *  teams into a transport and for attaching individual units into transports.
 *
 *  Because ObjectClass.Next is also used for tracking occupiers of a
 *  single cell, this dual-use behaviour can result in the
 *  transport getting attached to its own cargo in edge cases
 *  where a cell has multiple units.
 *  This bug later causes the transport to disappear when it unloads its cargo.
 *
 *  This function only attaches the given object to the cargo,
 *  making it possible to fix the mentioned bug.
 *
 *  Authors: 10/31/1994 JLB: CargoClass::Attach from Red Alert 1 source code
 *           08/17/2024 Rampastring: Changes to only attach one object.
