/**
 *  #issue-81
 * 
 *  Fixes the bug where the Jumpjet uses the wrong DoType when firing on
 *  the ground. This was because the original code did not check if the infantry
 *  was actually in the air and assumed it always is, thus setting DO_FIREFLY.
 * 
 *  @warning: This patch is within a branch that has already checked if the
 *            infantry is controlled by the Jumpjet locomotor!
