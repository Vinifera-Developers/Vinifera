# User Interface

This page lists all user interface additions, changes, fixes that are implemented in Vinifera.

## Sidebar

### Tabs

- Vinifera enhances the Tiberian Sun sidebar by introducing tabs similar to those found in Red Alert 2.
- There are four tabs, just like in Red Alert 2; however, due to the absence of a defense queue, the "Defenses" tab has been replaced by a new "Special" tab. This tab contains Superweapons and aircraft.
- Vinifera also introduces new hotkeys for quick tab switching and placing the currently available building (in the case of the Structure tab).
- The new sidebar feature must be enabled in `VINIFERA.INI`.

In `VINIFERA.INI`:
```ini
[Features]
NewSidebar=no  ; boolean, whether the game should use the new sidebar.
```

- Sample graphics for the new sidebar are available [here](https://github.com/Vinifera-Developers/Vinifera-Files/tree/master/files).

### Cameo Sorting

- Vinifera introduces automatic sorting for cameos that appear on the sidebar.
- Cameos are sorted by side (player's side items appear first, followed by others in side order) and then by type.
- Walls are always sorted after regular buildings, gates after walls, and base defenses after gates. This organization is designed to help players locate base defenses on the sidebar in the absence of a dedicated Defense tab.
- When other factors are equal, cameos are sorted by their index in their respective list.

In `RULES.INI`:
```ini
[SOMEBUILDING]             ; BuildingType
SortCameoAsBaseDefense=no  ; boolean, is this building considered a base defense for the purposes of sorting
```

- This sorting feature can be turned off in `SUN.INI`.

In `SUN.INI`:
```ini
[Options]
SortDefensesAsLast=yes  ; boolean, are base defenses sorted to the end of the sidebar by default.
```

### Descriptions

- Tooltips displayed when hovering over icons on the sidebar have been expanded.
- By default, hovering over an icon will display the object's name and price. Additionally, a description can be specified for TechnoTypes, which will appear after the price.

In `RULES.INI`:
```ini
[SOMETECHNO]        ; TechnoType
Description=Basic infantry.@@Cheap and effective against infantry and light vehicles, but very short-ranged.
```

You can use `@` to force a linebreak, just like with most text in the game.

```{note}
Due to limitations of the game's tooltip system, the length of the description is limited to 200 characters.
```

### Queues

- Vinifera allows the players to batch queue/dequeue units.
- You can hold `SHIFT` while queueing to queue 5 units at a time.
- You can hold `CONTROL` while dequeueing to dequeue 5 units at a time, or `SHIFT` to dequeue all units of that type.

```{warning}
Due to implementation details, it is recommended that you do not make the queue longer than 50 units. Dequeueing more than 63 units at a time could potentially result in other actions being done by the player on the same frame being ignored by the game.
```

### Customizable Vanilla Modifier Keys

- Vinifera allows the player to customize the keys used for Force Move, Force Attack, Select and Queued Move.
```{note}
Due to engine limitations, these keys will not appear in the options menu and must be customized in KEYBOARD.INI
```

In `KEYBOARD.INI`:
```ini
[Hotkey]
ForceMove=18    ; key number, ALT
ForceAttack=17  ; key number, CONTROL
Select=16       ; key number, SHIFT
QueueMove=81    ; key number, Q if the new sidebar is off, otherwise Z
```

## Dropship Loadout

- The Tiberian Sun Map theme is now played on the Dropship Loadout screen (`DSHPLOAD` can be defined in THEME.INI to customise this.)
- Help text is now shown on the screen to aid the user.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73803386/120932514-13b3d200-c6ee-11eb-9538-3f812323cb9f.png)

## Loading screen

- PNG images can be used as an alternative to PCX images. This new system scans for the requested filename with the .PNG extension and use that if found, otherwise it will fall back to scanning and load the .PCX file.
```{note}
This system only supports 8-bit PNG. All other formats such as Greyscale, Paletted, Alpha and 16-bit are not supported.
```
Attached is a set of the original loading screens with a minor edit and saved as PNG for testing;

## Tactical UI

### Super Weapon Timers

- Super Weapon timers, similar to those found in Red Alert 2, can now be displayed on the tactical view. This is disabled by default and each relevant SuperWeaponType must have it enabled. Superweapons that are offline due to low power or are disabled via other purposes will not show.

In `RULES.INI`:
```ini
[SOMESUPERWEAPON]  ; SuperWeaponType
ShowTimer=no       ; boolean, when this superweapon is active, does its recharge timer display on the tactical view?
```

### Chat Improvements

- Vinifera adds a background behind the user typed messages that appear in-game to provide better readability.
- Additionally, Vinifera implements the system to echo the user's sent messages back to them in-game as a confirmation they were sent. This is an enhancement from Red Alert 2.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73803386/137031682-3f265d48-7f28-410f-bf0d-3260e24f1748.png)

TextLabelBackgroundTransparency=50  ; unsigned integer, the transparency of the text background fill. Ranged between 0 and 100.
```

### Unit Health Bar

- Vinifera allows customizing the position of the heath bar.

In `UI.INI`:
```ini
[Ingame]
UnitHealthBarPos=-25,-16     ; Point2D, the draw position of the unit health bar

```

### Unit Pips

- The location of the control group number and veterancy pips can now be customized.

## Miscellaneous

- Vinifera adds support for 8-bit (paletted and non-paletted) PCX and 8-bit PNG cameos. This system auto-detects and prioritises the PNG or PCX file if found, no additional settings are required.
- Vinifera thickens the waypoint and rally point lines and adds stroke/outline to the waypoint number.
- Vinifera adds a "Load Game" button to the retry dialog shown after a failed mission.
- Vinifera changes the game to save screenshots as a PNG file instead of PCX file. In addition to this, it also changes the filename format to be unique. Instead of writing `SCRN[0000-9999].PNG`, the game now writes `SCRN_[date-time].PNG` (example, `SCRN_02-06-2021_12-51-40.PNG`).
