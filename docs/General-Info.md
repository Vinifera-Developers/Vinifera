# General Info

This page lists general info that should be known about the project.

## Build types

There are going to be three main types of Vinifera builds:
- *stable builds* - those are numbered like your regular versions (something close to semantic versioning, e.g. version 1.2.3 for example) and ideally should contain no bugs, therefore are safe to use in mods;
- *development builds* - those are the builds which contain functionality that needs to be tested. They are numbered plainly starting from 0 and incrementing the number on each release. Mod authors still can include those versions with their mods if they want latest features, though we can't guarantee lack of bugs;
- *nightly builds* - bleeding edge versions which can include prototypes, proofs of concepts, scrapped features etc., in other words - we can't guarantee anything in those builds and they absolutely should NOT be used in mod releases and should only be used to help with development and testing.

So far the development is at the stage when only nightly builds are produced.

## Compatibility

Vinifera is designed to be used alongside [CnCNet TS patches and spawner](https://github.com/CnCNet/ts-patches) and eventually it's supposed to supersede them.
