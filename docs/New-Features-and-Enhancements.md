### CurleyShuffle

- `[General]->CurleyShuffle`, which controls if the aircraft will shuffle its position between firing at its target, can now be overriden on a per-type basis.

In `rulesmd.ini`:
```ini
[AircraftType]
CurleyShuffle=<boolean>  ; Should this aircraft shuffle its position between firing at its target? Defaults to the value of [General]->CurleyShuffle.
```
