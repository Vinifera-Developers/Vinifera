### Git branching model

Couple of notes regarding the Git practices. We use [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)-like workflow:
  - `master` is for stable releases, can have hotfixes pushed to it or branched off like a feature branch with the requirement of version increment and `master` being merged into `develop` after that;
  - `develop` is the main development branch;
  - `feature/`-prefixed branches (sometimes the prefix may be different if appropriate, like for big fixes or changes) are so called "feature branches" - those are branched off `develop` for every new feature to be introduced into it and then merged back. We use squash merge to merge them back in case of smaller branches and sometimes merge commit in case the branch is so big it would be viable to keep it as is.
  - `hotfix/`-prefixed branches may be used in a same manner as `feature/`, but with `master` branch, with a requirement of `master` being merged into `develop` after `hotfix/` branch was squash merged into `master`.
  - `release/`-prefixed branches are branched off `develop` when a new stable release is slated to allow working on features for a next release and stability improvements for this release. Those are merged with a merge commit into `master` and `develop` with a stable version number increase, after which the stable version is released.
- When you're working with your local & remote branches use **fast-forward** pulls to get the changes from remote branch to local, **don't merge remote branch into local and vice versa**, this creates junk commits and makes things unsquashable.

These commands will do the following for all repositories on your PC:
1) remove the automatic merge upon pull and replace it with a rebase;
2) highlight changes consisting of moving existing lines to another location with a different color.

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global branch.autoSetupRebase always
git config --global diff.colorMoved zebra
```

## Ways to help

Engine modding is a complicated process which is pretty hard to pull off, but there are also easier parts which don't require mastering the art of reverse-engineering or becoming a dank magician in C++.

### Research and reverse-engineering

You can observe how the stuff works by using the engine and note which other stuff influences the behavior, but sooner or later you would want to see the innards of that. This is usually done using such tools as disassemblers/decompilers ([IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/), [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)) to decipher what is written in the binary (`gamemd.exe` in case of the binary) and debuggers ([Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org)'s debugger is pretty good for that) to trace how the binary works.

```{hint}
Reverse-engineering is a complex task, but don't be discouraged, if you want to try your hands at it ask us in the Discord channel, we will gladly help ðŸ˜„
```

```{note}
[Assembly language](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) and C++ knowledge, understanding of computer architecture, memory structure, OOP and compiler theory would certainly help.
```

### Development

When you found out how the engine works and where you need to extend the logic you'd need to develop the code to achieve what you want. This is done by declaring a *hook* - some code which would be executed after the program execution reaches the certain address in binary. All the development is done in C++ using [TSpp](https://github.com/Vinifera-Developers/TSpp) (which provides a way to interact with TS code and inject code) and usually [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

#### Contributing changes to the project

To contribute a feature or some sort of a change you you would need a Git client (We recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)). Fork, clone the repo, preferably make a new branch, then edit/add the code or whatever you want to contribute. Commit, push, start a pull request, wait for it to get reviewed, or merged.

If you contribute something, please make sure:
- you write documentation for the change;
- you mention the change in the changelog and migration sections in the [what's new page](Whats-New.md);
- you mention your contribution in the [credits page](CREDITS.md).

```{hint}
Every pull request push trigger a nightly build for the latest pushed commit, so you can check the build status at the bottom of PR page, press `Show all checks`, go to details of a build run and get the zip containing built DLL and PDB (for your testers, f. ex.), or download a build from an automatically posted comment.
```

```{note}
You'd benefit from C++ experience, knowledge of programming patterns, common techniques etc. [Basic assembly knowledge](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) would help to correctly write the interaction with the memory where you hook at. Basic understanding of Git and GitHub is also needed.
```

### Testing

This is a job that any modder (and even sometimes player) can do. Look at a new feature or a change, try to think of all possible cases when it can work differently, try to think of any possible logic flaws, edge cases, unforeseen interactions or conditions etc., then test it according to your thoughts. Any bugs should be reported to issues section of this repo, if possible.

```{warning}
**General stability** can only be achieved by extensive play-testing of new changes, both offline and online. Most modders have beta testing teams, so please, if you want the extension to be stable - contribute to that by having your testers play with the new features! Also the check-list below can help you identify issues quicker.
```

#### Testing check-list

- **All possible valid use cases covered**. Try to check all of the valid feature use cases you can think of and verify that they work as intended with the feature.
- **Correct saving and loading**. Most of the additions like new INI tags require storing them in saved object info. Sometimes this is not done correctly, especially on complex stuff (like radiation types). Please, ensure all the improvements work __identically__ before and after being saved and loaded (on the same version of Vinifera, of course).
- **Interaction with other features**. Try to use the feature chained or interacting with other features from vanilla or other libs (for example, mind control removal warhead initially was crashing when trying to remove mind control from a permanently mind-controlled unit).
- **Overlapping features not working correctly** (including those from third-party libs like Ares, HAres, CnCNet spawner DLL). Think of what features' code could overlap (in a technical sense; means they modify the same code) with what you're currently testing. Due to the nature of the project some features from other libs could happen to not work as expected if they are overlapping (for example, when implementing mass selection filtering Ares' `GroupAs` was initially broken and units using it weren't being type selected properly).
- **Edge/corner cases**. Those are the cases of some specific cases usually induced by some extreme parameter values or the combination of them (for example, vanilla game crashes on zero-size `PreviewPack` instead of not drawing it).

```{note}
Knowledge on how to mod TS and having an inquisitive mind, being attentive to details would help.
```

### Writing docs

No explanation needed. If you fully understand how some stuff in Vinifera works you can help by writing a detailed description in these docs, or you can just improve the pieces of docs you think are not detailed enough.

The docs are written in Markdown (which is dead simple, [learn MD in 60 seconds](https://commonmark.org/help/); if you need help on extended syntax have a look at [MyST parser reference](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/)). We use [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/) to build docs, [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.io/) to host.

```{hint}
You don't need to install Python, Sphinx and modules to see changes - every pull request you make is being built and served by Read the Docs automatically. Just like the nightly builds, scroll to the bottom, press `Show all checks` and see the built documentation in the details of a build run.
```

There are two ways to edit the docs.
- **Edit from your PC**. Pretty much the same like what's described in [contributing changes section](contributing-changes-to-the-project); the docs are located in the `docs` folder.
- **Edit via online editor**. Navigate to the doc piece that you want to edit, press the button on the top right - and it will take you to the file at GitHub which you would need to edit (look for the pencil icon to the top right). Press it - the fork will be created and you'll edit the docs in your version of the repo (fork). You can commit those changes (preferably to a new branch) and make them into a pull request to main repo.

```{note}
OK English grammar and understanding of docs structure would be enough. You would also need a GitHub account.
```

### Providing media to showcase features

Those would be used in docs and with a link to the respective mod as a bonus for the mod author. To record GIFs you can use such apps as, for example, [GifCam](http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/).

```{note}
Please, provide screenshots, GIFs and videos in their natural size and without excess stuff or length.
```

### Promoting the work

You can always help us by spreading the word about the project among people, whether you're an influential youtuber, a C&C related community leader or just an average player.
