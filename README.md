# Intro
Vinifera is an open source community project which aims to provide new features and bug-fixes fixes for Tiberian Sun.


# Community
You can discuss the development and progress of this project on the **C&C Modding Haven** [Discord server](<https://discord.gg/sZeMzz6qVg>) at the **`#vinifera-chat`** channel.


# Downloading Vinifera
### Nightly
Every day, an automated build of the `develop` branch is uploaded. These builds contain all the latest merged features, but are not yet considered stable for release. These builds are to help provide an insight to what the next release will contain and should only be used for active playtesting purposes **only**.

There are two version of the Nightly builds available; **"Standard"** and **"Comptability"**. The **Standard** build is _as-is_, where as the **Comptability** build has modifications to ensure compatability _(where possible)_ with existing community patches. If you are unsure which version is best for you, you can ask a developer on the **Discord** server.
You can find the latest Nightly builds [here](<https://nightly.link/Vinifera-Developers/Vinifera/blob/develop/.github/workflows/nightly.yml>).

### Release
All release builds are made from the `master` branch. Vinifera is currently working towards its first release so there are no releases available yet, but they will be uploaded to [here](<https://github.com/Vinifera-Developers/Vinifera/releases>).

### Installing Vinifera
Download your desired version. Once the desired download is finished, extract the contents of the archive into to the Tiberian Sun directory. Run `LaunchVinifera.exe` to start the game with the Vinifera extension applied.


# Installing Tiberian Sun

<b><img width="190" src="https://thecodeconquerors.github.io/img/tibsun_logo.png" alt="Tiberian Sun"></b><br>
Tiberian Sun was released as freeware by Electronic Arts in 2010 as a part of a promotional build-up to the release of Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight.

The original links to these downloads on the Electronic Arts servers are no longer active, but an unofficial mirror can be found at the [C&C-Comm Center](<https://cnc-comm.com/>).<br>
Below are direct links to the released disk images *(English (US) only)*;<br>
**GDI Disk**: [Download](<https://cnc-comm.com/tiberian-sun/downloads/the-game/gdi-disc>).<br>
